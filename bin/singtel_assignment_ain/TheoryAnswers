Part A
1)
a)  Using Junit
b)  I changed the Animal class to an interface for easy maintenance since Birds are not the only Animal
	It would be easier to implement the different methods to other Animals later on. 
3)
b) Rooster is a chicken
c) I tried using anonymous inner classes, but I believe you can also try it with maybe composition and several other ways

4)
d) 	In this case you would just have to create a class for the animal sound that you want the parrot to sing
	then you just create an instance of that animal in parrot and then call the sing method.
	
Part B
3) Abstract can implement interface without having to implement all the codes, just particular ones
